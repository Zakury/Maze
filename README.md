# Maze Game
A maze game prototype. Much improved! The walls have been changed into being full cells, and the code is much cleaner and easier to read. 
I haven't optimized the Game code yet, that should come soon.
To run the program, run ``game.py``. ``maze.py`` just generates the maze in a 2d list.

# How to play
WASD to move. I may add arrow keys soon.
Currently my movement system hurts my hands, I am thinking of a way to redo it.

# Installation
Download the reposititory and install the requirements.
To install the requirements: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
